CMake is flexible
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

CMake is a highly flexible build system, but hard to use.

You might:

1. Manually write many ``custom targets`` to help cmake build up its dependency graph to build anything you like.
2. Use `ExternalProject`_ to pull projects from github, build and install to any directory you like

But ...

- Being flexible means being frustrated to get it configured right
  - You don't know the best practice while having no the time to skim through all approaches
- Being flexible preserves way too much functionalities, and you're simply writing code to choose what you want indeed
